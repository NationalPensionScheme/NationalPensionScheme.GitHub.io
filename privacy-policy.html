    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected, used, and shared when you visit NationalPensionScheme.GitHub.io (the "Site"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you understand how your information is handled.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Information Collection</strong></p>
    <p>This site is a static website with informational content. There are no forms or scripts that actively collect personal data. Therefore, the site itself does not directly collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from users.</p>

    <p>However, please be aware of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> GitHub Pages, which hosts this site, may collect certain log data, including IP addresses and usage information, for operational purposes. Refer to GitHub's privacy policy for more details.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> It is possible that linked external websites, or embedded content if any were added later, could collect user data. This current version of the site contains links to the official nps website which is controlled by the Indian government. This privacy policy does not extend to those sites. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> The static nature of this site, as currently deployed, does not utilize cookies. However, GitHub Pages or linked third-party services could potentially use cookies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Use of Information</strong></p>
    <p>As this site does not directly collect PII, there is no direct usage of user data by this site itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GitHub Pages may use log data for site maintenance and analytics.</li>
        <li>Linked third party sites will use data according to their own policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. Data Sharing</strong></p>
    <p>Since this site does not collect personal data, there is no sharing of user information with third parties by this website itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GitHub Pages may share log data as described in their privacy policy.</li>
        <li>Linked third party sites share data according to their own policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>5. Data Security</strong></p>
    <p>Given that this site is static and does not collect PII, there are no specific data security measures implemented directly by this site.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GitHub Pages provides security for its hosting platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6. User Rights</strong></p>
    <p>As this site does not collect PII, there are no specific user rights related to data access, correction, or deletion applicable to this site itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users should refer to the privacy policies of GitHub and any linked third-party services for information on their respective data rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>7. Contact Information</strong></p>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Since this is a static github page, there is no direct contact information. For issues related to github pages, please refer to github documentation. For questions related to the National Pension Scheme itself, please refer to the official nps website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>8. Updates to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>
    <p>This privacy policy is based on the current state of the provided GitHub repository and its deployed website. It is essential to conduct regular reviews and updates to ensure accuracy and compliance with evolving legal requirements. It is strongly recommended to consult with a legal professional to ensure your privacy policy is legally sound.</p>
