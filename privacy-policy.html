                <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected, used, and shared when you visit
                    NationalPensionScheme.GitHub.io (the "Site"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
                    that you understand how your information is handled.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Information Collection</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This site is a static website and does not directly collect any personally identifiable information
                    (PII) from users. PII includes data that can be used to identify an individual, such as names,
                    addresses, or email addresses.
                </p>

                <p>However, please be aware of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> GitHub Pages, which hosts this site, may collect log data, including
                        IP addresses and usage information, for operational purposes. Please refer to the
                        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub
                            Privacy Policy</a> for more details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> This site contains links to the official National Pension
                        Scheme website, which is controlled by the Indian government. Users are strongly encouraged to
                        review the privacy policies of those sites, as this policy does not apply to their data practices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cookies:</strong> The static nature of this site, as currently deployed, does not utilize
                        cookies. However, GitHub Pages or linked third-party services could potentially use cookies.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. Use of Information</strong></p>
                <p>
                    As this site does not directly collect PII, there is no direct usage of user data by this site
                    itself.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub Pages may use log data for site maintenance and analytics.</li>
                    <li>Linked third party sites will use data according to their own policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Data Sharing</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Since this site does not collect personal data, there is no sharing of user information with third
                    parties by this website itself.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub Pages may share log data as described in their privacy policy.</li>
                    <li>Linked third party sites share data according to their own policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>5. Data Security</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Given that this site is static and does not collect PII, there are no specific data security measures
                    implemented directly by this site.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub Pages provides security for its hosting platform.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>6. User Rights</strong></p>
                <p>
                    As this site does not collect PII, there are no specific user rights related to data access,
                    correction, or deletion applicable to this site itself.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users should refer to the privacy policies of GitHub and any linked third-party services for
                        information on their respective data rights.
                    </li>
                </ul>
